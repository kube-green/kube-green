Thank you for installing kube-green!

Current realease for chart: {{ .Chart.Name }} is: {{ .Release.Name }}

kube-green adds default support to Deployments, StatefulSets, and CronJobs.

kube-green webhooks require a valid certificate to expose the webhook server to the Kubernetes API server.
The recommended way to handle certs for the webhook is by using cert-manager (which is enabled be default).
Current value for certManager is: {{ .Values.certManager.enabled }}
