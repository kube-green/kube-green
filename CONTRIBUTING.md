* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic

* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a

### Our Responsibilities 👥

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope 🌐

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. The representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and the necessary and appropriate response will be taken.
